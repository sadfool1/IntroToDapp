/*
Sometimes you need a more complex data type. For this, Solidity provides structs:

struct Person {
  uint age;
  string name;
}

Structs allow you to create more complicated data types that have multiple properties.

Note that we just introduced a new type, string. Strings are used for arbitrary-length UTF-8 data. 
Ex. string greeting = "Hello world!"
