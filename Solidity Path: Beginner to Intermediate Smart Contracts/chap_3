/* 
The uint data type is an unsigned integer, meaning its value must be non-negative. 
There's also an int data type for signed integers.

Note: In Solidity, uint is actually an alias for uint256, a 256-bit unsigned integer. 
You can declare uints with less bits â€” uint8, uint16, uint32, etc. 
But in general you want to simply use uint except in specific cases, which we'll talk about in later lessons.
