Who Made CryptoZombies and Why Is It Free?
Loom Network (https://loomx.io/). They're building a platform for running large-scale applications on Ethereum sidechains.

They think blockchains are capable of a lot more than just payments, and they want to get more developers thinking outside the box and trying to build large-scale DApps. Games are one of the areas where they think blockchain will really revolutionize things. So they built CryptoZombies to help educate and inspire the next generation of blockchain game devs.

Aside from CryptoZombies, they're working on some really cool projects. If you'd like to follow us, get in touch for a project, or just say hi, you can find them on Twitter and our Telegram chat, or email them at team@loomx.io
